# Wormhole Console 🌌
### Wormhole Sunshine and Tailscale Utility

Wormhole Console is a cinematic, sci-fi themed controller for managing remote access services on Windows. It provides a centralized, audio-reactive interface to toggle Tailscale VPN and Sunshine Streamer with a single click.

Instead of digging through service menus or system trays, Wormhole turns network management into a tactile experience.
